Glossary of Terms</H1>
The following list of terms are common to postprocessing, UG/POST and the
UG/POST Builder.

<P><A NAME="Address"></A><B>Address</B> -- In NC output, this tells the
NC controller where to store the contents of a value and what that value
represents. Examples: <I>X1.234, G01, M05, S1445.&nbsp; </I>The terminology
of Address, Word Address and Word all refer to the same element.&nbsp;
The are used interchangably in UG/POST Builder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="Block"></A><B>Block</B> -- A line of output sent to the NC
controller.&nbsp; Each block consists of words that may be separated by
a separator and terminated by an end-of-line.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; <I>N0100
G01 X.1.234 Y1.234 Z1.234 F100. S1500 M03.</I>

<P><A NAME="Custom Command"></A><B>Custom Command</B> -- In UG/POST Builder,
this allows you to create a custom procedure referred to as a PROC, consisting
of custom Tcl code.&nbsp; These can then be added to the existents events
and sequences by the UG/POST Builder.&nbsp; These custom commands <I>add
functions </I>which cannot be added by the UG/POST Builder.

<P><A NAME="Definition file"></A><B>Definition file</B> -- This file, with
the file extension .def, describes the static characteristics of the blocks
and their available list of addresses and formats for a specific machine/tool
controller.&nbsp; Also referred to as the <I>def </I>file and has a corresponding
Tcl and pui file for each postprocessor.

<P><A NAME="Event"></A><B>Event</B> -- This is sent to the postprocessor
by the Event Generator.&nbsp; When you postprocess, a series of Events
is sent, and with each Event, numerous variables are defined.&nbsp; An
<I>Event </I>is therefore a collection of data which is processed by UG/POST,
creating data which causes a specific action(s) by the machine tool/controller.

<P><A NAME="Event Generator"></A><B>Event Generator </B>-- The mechansim
in UG/CAM that extracts the tool path information from UG and passes it
to UG/POST as Events and variables.&nbsp; The Event Generator is started
when you select <I>OK </I>or <I>Aplly </I>from a selection of a program
and a postprocessor in the interactive CAM session.

<P><A NAME="Event Handler"></A><B>Event Handler </B>-- A file containing
Tcl code which are procedures that determine what is to be done with each
Event.&nbsp; each procedure will determine if output is to be generated
and if so, what blocks will be output.&nbsp; Unigraphics extends the Tcl
scripting language to allow you to easily construct output blocks based
on the Definition file.&nbsp; These extensions are available from within
an Event Handler.&nbsp; The Event Handler can also process the variables
which are loaded by the Event Generator before outputting a block.&nbsp;
Examaple: <I>my_post.tcl</I>

<P><A NAME="Extensions"></A><B>Extensions -- </B>Unigraphics extends the
Tcl scripting language by adding several commands for postprocessing.&nbsp;
This makes the task of outputting easier and reduce the amount of Tcl code
required.&nbsp; These all begin with the prefix <I>MOM_.&nbsp; </I>Example:
<I>MOM_do_template.</I>

<P><A NAME="Global variable"></A><B>Global variable </B>-- These are variables
that are available to all procedures in the Event Handler.&nbsp; They are
also available to block templates in the Definition file.&nbsp; If you
need to add a variable that <I>different </I>procedures will access, then
you must declare the variable as <I>global.</I>

<P><A NAME="Leader"></A><B>Leader </B>-- In the Definition file, this is
the character(s) used to represent the address.&nbsp; In UG/POST, the default
leader is the address.&nbsp; Examples: <I>X,G.</I>&nbsp; In the NC output,
the leader can be blanks or other characters output before the start of
program.&nbsp; In this context, leader was originally used for threading
paper tape readers.

<P><A NAME="Marker"></A><B>Marker </B>-- Within a UG/POST Builder sequence,
markers indicate the possible Events that may occur.&nbsp; Each marker/event
may include several blocks of information.&nbsp; Example: <I>Start_of_Path.&nbsp;
</I>Within the Events in machine control, there are several markers that
allow the CAM user to control the order in which some of the output will
be generated.&nbsp; For example, output an operator message with the Start
of Program marker.

<P><A NAME="mom_variable"></A><B>mom_variable </B>-- The variables which
are set by the Event Genarator as each Event is generated.&nbsp; They are
always global variables.&nbsp; Example: <I>mom_feed_rate.</I>

<P><A NAME="MOM"></A><B>MOM </B>-- An acronym for the Unigraphics <B>M</B>anufacturing
<B>O</B>utput <B>M</B>anager. This is the basic functionality in Unigraphics
CAM that also is used to generate shop documentation, output the CLS, UG
library access and UG Post.&nbsp; Lower case mom is used for variables,
for eample <I>mom_feed_rate.&nbsp; </I>Upper case MOM refers to either
Event Handler names, for example <I>MOM_linear_move</I> or Extensions,
for example <I>MOM_do_template</I>.

<P><A NAME="Operation End Sequence"></A><B>Operation End Sequence </B>--
In an NC program contains the Events and actions that will occur from the
final retract motion to the end of the Operation.

<P><A NAME="Operation Start Sequence"></A><B>Operation Start Sequence </B>--
In an NC program contains the Events and actions that will occur from the
start of an Operation to the first cut motion.

<P><A NAME="Operator Message"></A><B>Operator Message</B> -- This a message
contain within NC code that sends instructions to the console of a machine
tool.&nbsp; This usually requires special codes in the NC code such as
"(" or "(.msg" to differentiate between the message and machine/control
information.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; <I>N0010 (*** Tool number 12 ***).</I>

<P><A NAME="Postprocessor"></A><B>Postprocessor</B> -- Commonly referred
to as the "post", this is the mechanism that converts the tool path information
from a CAM system's tool path format to a format for a specific machine/tool
controller.&nbsp; In UG/POST, this includes an Event Handler file (.tcl),
a Definition file (.def) and a Post Builder User Interface file (.pui).&nbsp;
The use of these files with each post is determined by the postprocessor
template file.

<P><A NAME="Postprocessor template file"></A><B>Postprocessor template
file </B>-- This file contains the list of postprocessors available to
the user user in a CAM session.&nbsp; This file is selected as part of
the CAM configuaration (TEMPLATE_POST) or by a library machine tool.&nbsp;
Example: <I>template_post.dat.</I>

<P><A NAME="Procedure"></A><B>Procedure </B>-- Also referred to as <I>proc,
</I>this is a part of a Tcl program that is analogous to a subroutine.&nbsp;
For every Event that the post needs to react to, there is a procedure in
the Event Handler file.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; <I>MOM_start_of_parogram.</I>

<P><A NAME="Program End Sequence"></A><B>Program End Sequence </B>-- In
an NC program contains the Events and actions that will occur from the
end of the last Operation to the end of the Program.

<P><A NAME="Program Start Sequence"></A><B>Program Start Sequence </B>--
In an NC program contains the Events and actions that will occur from the
start of the program to the start of the first Operation.

<P><A NAME="pui file"></A><B>pui file</B> -- This is used by UG/POST Builder
to define a postprocessor.&nbsp; This file, along with the .tcl and .def
files, makes a complete post.&nbsp; The .pui file is not required to actually
postprocess, but is required for you to edit existing postprocessors.&nbsp;
Example: <I>my_post.pui.</I>

<P><A NAME="Review Tool"></A><B>Review Tool </B>-- After postprocessing,
the Review Tool will display a window of three columns showing all the
Events, variables and output blocks that were processed.&nbsp; For example,
you can select an Event, see what variables are set and what blocks are
used for output.

<P><A NAME="Sequence"></A><B>Sequence -- </B>In the UG/POST Builder, this
is a series of markers at common areas in a program.&nbsp; They are used
to group several Events and blocks for output in a specific sequence.&nbsp;
Example: <I>Operation Start Sequence.</I>

<P><A NAME="Tcl"></A><B>Tcl</B> -- Tcl (pronounced tee-cee-el), which stands
for Tool Command Language, is a scripting language that has become popular
because of its ease of use.&nbsp; Tcl has another component, Tk, a user
interface tool.&nbsp; WISH, a windows shell also contains Tk.

<P><A NAME="Tk"></A><B>Tk -- </B>Tk is a user interface tool that may be
used in conjunction with Tcl.&nbsp; Tk provides basic user interface tools
such as buttons, check boxes and scroll bars.

<P><A NAME="tcl file"></A><B>tcl file</B> -- see Event Handler.

<P><A NAME="UG/Post Execute"></A><B>UG/Post Execute -- </B>Unigraphics
provides a postprocessor, UG/POST, which utilizes Unigraphics tool path
data as input and outputs machine controller readable NC code.&nbsp; UG/POST
is customization through the use of user created Event handler and Definition
files.&nbsp; These files, in conjunction with UG/POST, are used to generate
output for the simplest to the most complex of machine tool/controller
combinations.

<P><A NAME="UG/POST Builder"></A><B>UG/POST Builder -- </B>Provides an
easy to use interface for creating and modifying postprocessors.&nbsp;
drag and drop functions allows for the creation of formats, words, blocks
and sequences.&nbsp; The Post Builder allows the deinition of output blocks,
formats for addresses and controls the sequence of output for the start
and end of operations, the start and end of program, tool changes and canned
cycles.

<P><A NAME="User Defined Event"></A><B>User Defined Event -- </B>Also referred
to as UDE, this is an Event that can be changed by the user.&nbsp; UDE's
are used in machine control and as the <I>start post</I> and <I>end post</I>
commands.&nbsp; UDE's can be attached to any CAM object such as a Tool
or Program.&nbsp; Several of the basic UDE are included with CAM and users
may modify them or add their own.

<P><A NAME="Wish"></A><B>Wish -- </B>WISH is an ancronym for windows shell
that includes both Tcl and Tk.&nbsp; Wish is an intrepeter and executes
Tcl and Tk commands.&nbsp; It is required in order to use the <I>UG/POST
Review Tool</I>.&nbsp; It is installed as <I>ugwish.exe</I> and is located
in the <I>mach/auxiliary</I> directory.

<P><A NAME="Word"></A><B>Word</B> -- See Address
