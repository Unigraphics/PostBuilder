<A NAME="Program and Tool Path"></A>Program and Tool Path</H1>
<IMG SRC="imageg9i.jpg" HEIGHT=118 WIDTH=1006>

<P>The <B>Program and Tool Path</B> tab has options that allows you to
determine the NC output for specific events and commands that are generated
by the Unigraphics Event Generator.&nbsp; The tabs under this option control
the content, format and order of output for your NC Code.
<H2>
<A NAME="Program"></A>Program</H2>
Post Builder breaks down your NC program into five distinct<A NAME="sequences."></A>
sequences.&nbsp; Each one of the sequences allows the user to control the
exact output that is needed for that sequence.&nbsp; Some functions,&nbsp;
such as the rewind stop code and program end, are needed only at the start
and end of NC programs.&nbsp; There are also functions,&nbsp; tool change
sequences, starting and turning off the spindle, turning the coolant on
and off and applying tool offsets, are needed only at the start and end
of operations.&nbsp; You can also control the output from the remaining
tool path events such as linear motion, circular motion, etc. by the use
of the tool path sequence.

<P>In each sequence dialog there are&nbsp;<A NAME="markers."></A>markers.&nbsp;
These are the yellow boxes located in the left column of the screen.&nbsp;
The markers represent events that occur in the tool path.&nbsp; When events
occur in the tool path while post processing, you can then determine the
NC blocks that are to be output.&nbsp; The markers are fixed and cannot
be changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plus or minus sign to the left of the yellow
marker can be toggled to display the blocks attached it.

<P>The information in the sequences can be displayed in two different modes,
combined mode and uncombined mode.

<P><IMG SRC="imaged4o.jpg" HEIGHT=333 WIDTH=648>

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Display Combined N/C Code Blocks"></A><B>Display Combined
N/C Code Blocks</B> is toggled off.&nbsp; In this mode the information
is displayed in the uncombined mode.

<P><IMG SRC="imager0n.jpg" HEIGHT=167 WIDTH=572>

<P>The <B>Display Combined N/C Code Blocks</B> is toggled on.&nbsp; In
this mode the blocks are displayed as they will be output in the combined
mode.&nbsp; You can use this mode to get an idea of the combining of the
blocks will be done.

<P>Each of the sequence dialogs have the same basic options.&nbsp; In a
sequence dialog you can&nbsp;<A NAME="Add, copy or delete blocks."></A>add,
copy or delete blocks.&nbsp;&nbsp; To add a block, you need to first select
the block you wish to add to a particular marker.&nbsp; You can do this
from this block selection pull down dialog.

<P>Once you have selected the block you wish to add, depress and hold the
left mouse button on the&nbsp;<A NAME="Add Block"></A><B>Add Block</B>
button and drag the block to the desired marker.&nbsp;<A NAME="Drag and drop blocks"></A>You
now have the option now of placing your new block before, with or after
any existing block that is already being output with that marker.&nbsp;
Continue to hold down the mouse button until the existing block is highlighted.&nbsp;
The highlight will appear either above, below or completely around the
existing block.&nbsp; To place the new block before an existing block release
the mouse when the highlight appears above the existing block.&nbsp; To
place the new block after an existing block release the mouse when the
highlight appears below the existing block.&nbsp;&nbsp; To place the new
block with an existing block release the mouse when the highlight appears
around the existing block.&nbsp; If there are no existing blocks being
output with the desired marker, then drag the new block until the highlight
appears to the right of the marker and the release the mouse button.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><IMG SRC="imageh2o.jpg" HEIGHT=185 WIDTH=672>

<P><IMG SRC="image2om.jpg" HEIGHT=106 WIDTH=638>

<P>With the entire existing block highlighted, the new block is placed
on the same line as the existing block.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><IMG SRC="imageov4.jpg" HEIGHT=182 WIDTH=689>

<P><IMG SRC="imageer6.jpg" HEIGHT=149 WIDTH=463>

<P>With the highlight appearing above the existing block, the new block
will be listed on a line above the existing block.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><IMG SRC="image52g.jpg" HEIGHT=179 WIDTH=672>

<P><IMG SRC="imagetm9.jpg" HEIGHT=149 WIDTH=463>

<P>With the highlight appearing below the existing block, the new block
will be listed on a line below the existing block.

<P>To remove an existing block from a marker, you can either right click
on the block and select <B>delete</B> or drag the block to trash can.

<P>You can also copy a block or blocks and paste them with another marker
in the same sequence.&nbsp; This is very useful, for instance, to make
the first and auto tool change events both output the same code.&nbsp;
To copy a single block, right click the right mouse button and select&nbsp;<A NAME="Copy As."></A><B>Copy
As</B>.&nbsp; You now can make a copy of the blocks using the&nbsp;<A NAME="Reference Block"></A><B>Reference
Block</B> option or use the <B>New Block</B> option to create completely
new blocks.&nbsp; The <B>New Block</B> option will allow you to edit the
new blocks without changing the original blocks.&nbsp; The <B>Reference
Block</B> option means that only one copy of the blocks exists and any
changes will apply to both.&nbsp; You can place the block using the same
techniques as the <B>Add Block</B> option.&nbsp; You can also copy all
the blocks associated with a marker by right clicking on the marker itself.&nbsp;
Now you can place all the blocks with another marker.

<P><A NAME="New Block"></A><B>New Block</B>
<BR>This option allows you to create a new block by adding word addresses
and text.&nbsp; Refer to the chapter on <A HREF="#Creating a New Block">Creating
a New Block</A> for a detailed description.

<P><IMG SRC="image8il.jpg" HEIGHT=752 WIDTH=1008>

<P><A NAME="Operator Message"></A><B>Operator Message</B>
<BR>This option allows you to create a block that will be specifically
created to output an operator message.&nbsp; A dialog will be presented
to allow you to enter the message text.&nbsp; The system will automatically
place the message start string and the message end&nbsp; string before
and after your text.&nbsp; Your text can contain any valid&nbsp;<A NAME="mom variables"></A>mom
variable as well as text.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the following example the variable
$mom_tool_number will be replaced by the current tool number when the post
processor is used.&nbsp; Note you must make sure that the variable exists
and is defined at the time of operation or a run-time error will occur.&nbsp;
See the online UG/Post documentation for a complete list of variables that
may be used.

<P><IMG SRC="image799.jpg" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=120 WIDTH=326>

<P>See the section on <A HREF="data_definitions.html#Message Start / Message End">Operator
Message</A> for information for defining the message start and end characters.

<P><A NAME="MOM_command"></A><B>MOM_command</B>
<BR>You can select from the list of blocks, blocks that were created to
perform specific functions.&nbsp; For example, MOM_set_seq_off, will turn
off all sequence number output.&nbsp; These blocks can be placed within
any sequence to perform their pre-defined function.&nbsp; For a complete
list of MOM_commands that can be used, see the online UG/Post documentation.

<P><A NAME="Custom Command"></A><B>Custom Command</B>
<BR>This option allows you to insert your own TCL procedure into your post
processor.&nbsp; After you have placed the block with the marker, a dialog
will appear to allow you to enter you custom TCL procedure.&nbsp; See the
section on <A HREF="custom_command.html">Custom Commands</A> for more details.

<P><A NAME="Existing Block"></A><B>Existing Block</B>
<BR>You can use a block that already exists.&nbsp; This could be a block
that was default with the system or is being output with another marker
or event.&nbsp; All the blocks in your current post can be selected.
