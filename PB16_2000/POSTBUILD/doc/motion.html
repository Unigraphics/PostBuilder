<A NAME="Motion (Lathe)"></A>Motion</H4>
The motion dialogs describe how your postprocessor will handle the&nbsp;<A NAME="GOTO records"></A>GOTO
records in the toolpath.&nbsp; There are more types of motion generated
by the system than can be output by most machine controls.&nbsp; All motion
generated by the system with a feedrate of zero is handled by the Rapid
Move event. This includes retract, approach, departure, return, rapid and
traversal.&nbsp; If any of these&nbsp;<A NAME="motion types"></A>motion
types have a non-zero feedrate, then the Linear Move event will be used.&nbsp;
The Linear Move event will be used to all the&nbsp;<A NAME="cutting motion"></A>cutting
motion types.&nbsp; These included cut, engage, first cut, stepover and
side cut.&nbsp; All circular motion is handled by the Circle Move event.&nbsp;
Note that a threading pass usually consists of a Linear Move (infeed),
the threading motion itself (Lathe Thread Move), the pullout move (linear
or rapid depending on the feed rate) and the traversal move(linear or rapid
depending on the feed rate).&nbsp; Several user defined events (<A NAME="GOHOME"></A>GOHOME
and&nbsp;<A NAME="RETRCT"></A>RETRCT) also generate motion and they use
the Rapid Move event to output.&nbsp; The Nurbs event will be handled in
a future release of Post Builder.

<P>The motion dialogs contain codes such as S, M03, M08, G41, G17 and D.&nbsp;
This is done to output these codes with motion.&nbsp; They will be output
only if the data changes or they are being forced out with alignment,&nbsp;
The data for turning on the coolant will be defined by a user defined event
(COOLNT/FLOOD).&nbsp; This event will occur either before the Start of
Operation or in its sequence in the Start Post commands, depending on how
the event was specified.&nbsp; The most reliable method of outputting the
coolant in this case is to have it come output in the first G01 block,
before you start cutting.&nbsp; See the <A HREF="machine_control.html#Machine Control">Machine
Control</A> section on more information on the recommended methods of outputting
machine control information.

<P><IMG SRC="image6jo.jpg" HEIGHT=408 WIDTH=1008>

<P>The motion dialog shows you a summary what each of the motion types
for lathe will output.&nbsp; You can click on any one of the blue buttons
and edit that motion event.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
<A NAME="Linear Move"></A>Linear Move</H4>
<IMG SRC="image23m.jpg" HEIGHT=413 WIDTH=808>

<P>This event dialog will allow to define the output for linear motion.&nbsp;
You can change the linear motion G-code with this dialog.&nbsp; With this
event dialog you can add additional blocks or words to your motion block.&nbsp;
If you need the F code output before the motion block, simply drag the
F word until it highlights above the block.
<H4>
<A NAME="Circle Move"></A>Circle Move</H4>
<IMG SRC="image6e4.jpg" HEIGHT=551 WIDTH=808>

<P>The Circular Move event dialog will allow you to define the parameters
and blocks for outputting circles.&nbsp;&nbsp; This dialog allows you to
define the&nbsp;<A NAME="Circular Motion G code"></A>G-code (clockwise
or counterclockwise), that will be output with circle block.&nbsp; If you
need the G02 or G03 out with every block then right click on the G02 word
and set the option to force output.&nbsp; You can do this with any word
in any block in Post Builder.

<P>You can set the output to be&nbsp;<A NAME="full circle"></A>full circle
or output only&nbsp;<A NAME="quadrant boundaries."></A>quadrant boundaries.&nbsp;
With full circle output you will get a circle block for each 360 degrees
of the circle.&nbsp; If the input file has a circle that is 400 degrees,
you will get one block at 360 degrees and another with the endpoint at
400 degrees.&nbsp; If you set the output to quadrant boundaries you will
get a circle block for each quadrant boundary and another circle block
with the endpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that you will use the same circle event
block for each quardrant you output.

<P>You can also define the&nbsp;<A NAME="minimum and maximum radius"></A>minimum
and maximum radius that will be output in a circle record.&nbsp; If a circle
is processed that has a radius less than the minimum or greater than the
maximum, the circle will be approximated with linear moves using the circle
tolerance.

<P>The dialog for the&nbsp;<A NAME="Circles in other planes"></A>mill Circle
Move has an added capability of outputting circles in other planes.&nbsp;
You can specify that you want XY plane only, YZ plane only, ZX plane only
or all three planes.

<P><IMG SRC="image8se.jpg" HEIGHT=595 WIDTH=808>

<P>You can also define how the&nbsp;<A NAME="circle center"></A>circle
center will be specified.&nbsp; The choices on the dialog define what the
I and K words will output.&nbsp; If you need to output the&nbsp;<A NAME="Circle Radius Output"></A>radius
instead of I and K, you can find the address you need from the list addresses
as shown above.&nbsp; Pull down the address arrow until you see the R word
and select the Arc Radius.&nbsp; Now drop the R word into your block.&nbsp;
If you don't need both I, K and R, then remove the I and K and put them
in the trash can.
<H4>
<A NAME="Rapid Move"></A>Rapid Move (Lathe)</H4>
<IMG SRC="imagert7.jpg" HEIGHT=440 WIDTH=808>

<P>This dialog defines the G-code and output for the Rapid Move event.&nbsp;
This template will be used for all rapid moves in your postprocessor.&nbsp;
This event handles all of the motion types that are not cutting moves.&nbsp;
Additionally you can specify a feed rate at which your Linear Move will
be output using the Rapid Move event.

<P>Some controls require special codes in the rapid motion block.&nbsp;
For instance, the Bostomatic control requires a&nbsp;<A NAME="G01 and R"></A>G01
and R in the rapid motion block.&nbsp; To configure your rapid motion to
output this way, do the following:
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
Select the address pull down and select "text".</LI>

<LI>
Enter the character "R".</LI>

<LI>
Add the word to your rapid move block.</LI>

<LI>
Go to the G code tab and change the G code from 0 to 1 for rapid motion.</LI>
</OL>
Another example is a control that requires an&nbsp;<A NAME="G00 and F0"></A>F0
in addition to a G00 in the rapid motion block.&nbsp; To configure this
block, do the following:
<OL>
<LI>
Select the address pull down and select "F" and "user defined expression".</LI>

<LI>
Enter the value "0".</LI>

<LI>
Add the word to your rapid move block.</LI>
</OL>

Rapid Move (Mill)</H4>
<IMG SRC="image61t.jpg" HEIGHT=581 WIDTH=808>

<P>This dialog shows the two blocks that will be output for a rapid move.&nbsp;
The words "rap1" and "rap2" represent the X and Y words and the word "rap3"
represents the Z word if the spindle axis is Z.&nbsp; The following table
expains how rap1, rap2 and rap3 are defined.

<P>If the&nbsp;<A NAME="work plane change"></A>work plane change radio
button is selected, your post will break all rapid motion into two blocks.&nbsp;
Assuming you currently have specified Z as the spindle axis and if you
are moving the tool to a higher position, in the first block you will get
a Z move and in the second block you will get a XY move.&nbsp; Likewise,
if you are moving to a lower position along the tool axis, you will get
a XY move followed by a Z move.

<P>If the work plane change button is not selected, then you will get all
rapid motion in a single block.

<P>The rapid move event for four and five axes postprocessor is exactly
the same except the fourth and fifth axes are output with the non-spindle
axis.&nbsp; If you need a different sequence, you can output Z first, then
AB and then XY for example simply by moving the blocks around.
<H4>
<A NAME="Lathe Thread"></A>Lathe Thread</H4>
<IMG SRC="image6t3.jpg" HEIGHT=490 WIDTH=808>

<P>The Lathe Thread event dialog allows you to define the output for a
single threading pass.&nbsp; For&nbsp;<A NAME="turn threads"></A>turn threads
a block with G33 Z and K will be output and for&nbsp;<A NAME="face threads"></A>face
threads a block with G33 X and I will be output.&nbsp; For taper threads
a block with G33 X Z I and K will be output.&nbsp; You can also set the
G codes for inceasing and decreasing lead threads.

<P>The capability for a&nbsp;<A NAME="Thread cycle"></A>Thread cycle that
includes feed, thread, pullout and traverse in a single canned cycle thread
block is not currently available.&nbsp; A thread cycle event is not yet
available from Unigraphics.</BLOCKQUOTE>
