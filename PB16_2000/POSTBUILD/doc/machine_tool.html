<A NAME="Machine Tool"></A>Machine Tool</H1>
This section allows you to configure the kinematics of your machine tool.&nbsp;
You will be able to define the limits and axis orientation of each of the
axis. The Machine Tool dialog is divided into three sections. The general
parameters section is available for all machine tool types.&nbsp; The dialogs
for the fourth and fifth axes are available only for four and five axis
machine tools.

&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="image2le.jpg" HEIGHT=805 WIDTH=1079>

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Display Machine Tool"></A><B>Display Machine
Tool</B> will give you an up to date picture of your machine tool so that
you can visualize the axis orientations.&nbsp; For a four and five axis
milling machine it will also show the address leader designation (A,B or
C) and limits for each rotary axis.

<P><IMG SRC="image6oa.jpg" HEIGHT=731 WIDTH=943>

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Output Circular Record"></A><B>Output Circular
Record</B> can be set to Yes or No.&nbsp; If set to Yes, then all circles
that can be output based on the circle motion parameters will be output.&nbsp;
If set to No there will be no circle blocks, (G2 or G3) output.

<P><A NAME="Linear Axis Travel"></A><B>Linear Axis Travel Limit</B> is
not yet implemented and is for reference purposes only.

<P><A NAME="Home Position"></A><B>Home Position</B> defines the default
from position if a FROM is not specified.

<P><A NAME="Linear Motion Resolution"></A><B>Linear Motion Resolution</B>
defines the minimum value that all coordinate will be rounded to.&nbsp;
This does not necessarily control the format of the coordinate data.&nbsp;
You must change the number of decimal digits output to do that.

<P><A NAME="Traversal Feedrate"></A><B>Traversal Feedrate</B> defines the
feedrate that will be used to calculate machine time for rapid motion.&nbsp;
This value will also be used to determine if a linear feedrate move is
actually to be performed at rapid.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Rotary Axis Configuration"></A><B>Rotary Axis Configuration</B>
dialog allows you to define the&nbsp;<A NAME="Plane of Rotation"></A>Plane
of Rotation and&nbsp;<A NAME="Address Leader"></A>Address Leader for both
the fourth and the fifth axis.&nbsp; This dialog may be accessed from either
the fourth or the fifth axis configuration dialogs.&nbsp; Note that you
must make sure you change the Address Leader when you change the rotary
axis plane.&nbsp; Note that the plane of the fourth axis must be different
than the plane of the fifth axis.&nbsp; This dialog is only available for
specifying the parameters of a five-axis machine tool.&nbsp; It is not
available for a forages machine tool only.

<P><IMG SRC="imagehkf.jpg" HEIGHT=268 WIDTH=662>

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Machine Zero to Rotary Axis Center"></A><B>Machine
Zero to Rotary Axis Center</B> allows you to define where the center of
the fourth axis is in relation to your machine zero.&nbsp; This is the
3-d distance is set usually set to zero.&nbsp; This value must be programmed
correctly for the post processor to be able to map correctly between the
MCS programmed in UG and the Machine Tool Coordinate System.

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Rotary Motion Resolution"></A><B>Rotary Motion
Resolution</B> allows you to control the number of digits that the rotary
angle will be rounded to.&nbsp; This is typically .001 degrees for most
contouring axes.

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Maximum Rotary Feed Rate"></A><B>Maximum Rotary
Feed Rate</B> allows you to define the&nbsp;<A NAME="maximum degrees per minute"></A>maximum
degrees per minute that the fourth axis can rotate.&nbsp; If during a combined
linear and rotary move, the amount of rotation during that move exceeds
the maximum DPM, the post processor will reduce the federate so that it
does not exceed this value.

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Pivot Distance"></A><B>Pivot Distance</B> is
not valid for the dual rotary type five-axis machine tool.&nbsp; You can
define the distance from the pivot point to the spindle gage point.&nbsp;
This value may be specified with either the fourth or the fifth axis dialogs,
however there is only one pivot distance on the machine tool.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Angular Offset"></A><B>Angular Offset</B> option must
be used when a tool axis of (0,0,1) does not result in angular positions
of 0.0 for the fourth axis.&nbsp; This offset is needed for some Sundstrand
head/table machine tools.&nbsp; Enter the value that needs to be added
to adjust the rotary angle (usually -90).

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Axis Rotation"></A><B>Axis Rotation</B> defines
whether the fourth axis rotates according to the right-hand rule.&nbsp;
Standard is default and most rotary tables rotate clockwise to a larger
angle.&nbsp; If your table does not rotate according to the right-hand
rule, then set this value to Reverse.&nbsp; For example, if get a B90 when
you expect a B-90, you may need to use the reverse option.

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Axis Direction"></A><B>Axis Direction</B> defines
how your rotary table determines whether to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise.&nbsp;
The following options are available, Magnitude Determines Direction or
Sign Determines Direction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="Magnitude Determines Direction"></A><B>Magnitude Determines
Direction</B> denotes that the sign is used algebraically to determine
the angular position.&nbsp; B-90 and B90 are different positions on the
rotary axis and are 180 degrees apart.&nbsp; Rotation to a larger angle
is always clockwise and rotation to a smaller angel is always counter clockwise.&nbsp;
Typically the travel limits on this type of table is more than 360 degrees
(i.e. -9999 to 9999)

<P><A NAME="Sign Determines Direction"></A><B>Sign Determines Direction</B>
means that the sign is used only for direction of rotation.&nbsp; B90 and
B-90 are the same position on the rotary table.&nbsp; The minus sign on
B-90 means that the table will rotate counterclockwise from wherever it
was at to 90.&nbsp; Likewise, B90 means that the table will rotate clockwise
from wherever it was at to 90.&nbsp; Typically, the limits on this table
are from 0 to 360.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="Rotary Axis Limits"></A><B>Rotary Axis Limits</B> allows you to
control the minimum and maximum angles that can be programmed for the fourth
axis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the range of travel is limited to less than
360 degrees, you must specify the valid range of travel measuring clockwise
on the table.&nbsp; For instance, if the range of travel is 40 degrees,
plus or minus 20 degrees, the minimum angle would be specified as 340 degrees
(or -20) and the maximum angle would be specified as 20 degrees.&nbsp;
If the rotary axis has no limitation on travel, there are two possible
choices for the values for the minimum and maximum angles.&nbsp; If the
sign determines direction, you must select 0 degrees for the minimum and
360 for the maximum.&nbsp; If magnitude determines direction, the minimum
can at most be -359.999 degrees and the maximum has to be at least 359.999
degrees.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Rotary Axis Limit Violation"></A><B>Rotary Axis Limit
Violation</B> option specifies how the post processor will behave when
a rotary axis limit is reached.&nbsp; The post processor can either give
a warning only or retract, rotate then re-engage.

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Consecutive Linear Motions"></A><B>Consecutive
Linear Motions</B> allows you to combine output blocks that have the same
x, y and z values but have different rotary values.

<IMG SRC="image4n7.jpg" HEIGHT=805 WIDTH=1079>

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Rotary Axis Configuration"></A><B>Rotary Axis Configuration</B>
dialog allows you to define the Plane of Rotation and Address Leader for
both the fourth and the fifth axis.&nbsp; This dialog may be accessed from
either the fourth or the fifth axis configuration dialogs.&nbsp; See the
Fourth Axis section for details.

<P>The option&nbsp;<A NAME="Fourth Axis Rotary Center to Fifth Axis Rotary"></A><B>Fourth
Axis Rotary Center to Fifth Axis Rotary Center</B> allows you to define
the distance between the center of the fourth axis to the center of the
fifth axis.&nbsp; This 3-d distance is set usually set to zero.&nbsp; For
a dual rotary five-axis machine tool, this vector is the represents distance
between the axis vectors of the fourth axis and the fifth axis.&nbsp; For
a dual head five-axis machine tool, this distance is the distance between
the pivot points of the fourth and fifth axes. This value must be programmed
correctly for the post processor to be able to map correctly between the
MCS programmed in UG and the Machine Tool Coordinate System.&nbsp; See
Appendix A for a complete description.

<P>For the remainder of the options for the fifth axis parameters, see
the descriptions under Fourth Axis Parameters.&nbsp; The parameter descriptions
are the same for both the fourth and fifth axes.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Turret"></A><B>Turret </B>option allows you to define
whether you have one or two turrets.&nbsp; Currently the two turrets must
be a fixed distant apart and do NOT move independently.&nbsp; When you
select the two turret option, you must specify the names of the two turrets
and the&nbsp;<A NAME="Offset from primary to secondary head"></A>distance
between them.&nbsp; Currently, you must select from one of the six names
available for the names of the primary and secondary turrets.&nbsp; You
must use these names for the turrets in Unigraphics so that the post processor
knows whether or not to add the offsets.&nbsp; The distance is measured
from the primary turret to the secondary turret.&nbsp; This value will
be algebraically added to the x and z coordinates when the secondary head
is being used.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Lathe Output Method"></A><B>Lathe Output Method</B>
defines your basic tool tracking method.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><A NAME="Tool Tip"></A><B>Tool Tip</B> -- means that you want the x
and z values in your NC output file to represent the tool tip location.&nbsp;
This is accomplished by resetting the tool tip location with every tool
change.
<BR>The basic elements for tool tip programming are:
<UL>
<LI>
A FROM command at the beginning of the program to define the initial turret
reference position</LI>

<LI>
A G92 block with each tool change to take into account the change in offsets.</LI>

<LI>
A GOHOME or return to home position to return back to a common turret reference
position.</LI>
</UL>
<A NAME="Turret Reference"></A><B>Turret Reference</B> -- means that the
x and z values represent the turret reference location similar to the method
used for programming milling machines.
