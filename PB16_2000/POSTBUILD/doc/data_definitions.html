<A NAME="N/C Data Definitions"></A>N/C Data Definitions</H1>
There are two ways to view your post within Post Builder.&nbsp; One way
is the&nbsp;<A NAME="Program view"></A>Program view.&nbsp; The Program
&amp; Tool Path shows you the events that occur within your program and
the output blocks that will result.&nbsp; The NC Data Definitions section
shows you the blocks, words and formats in a similar format as to what
is written to the&nbsp;<A NAME="definition file."></A>definition file.&nbsp;
You can edit and create blocks and words that can then be used as output
in the sequences and events.&nbsp; This section has the following options
or tabs for you to choose from.

<A NAME="Block"></A>Block</H2>
<IMG SRC="image1nn.jpg" HEIGHT=752 WIDTH=1008>

<P>This dialog allows you to create and edit blocks.&nbsp; You have the
same options for creating a new block or editing a block as you do within
the event or sequence dialogs.&nbsp; When you create a new block from this
dialog you are basically copying an existing block and the editing it.&nbsp;
You are limited to a single block.&nbsp; If you need more than one block
for your function, you must create more than one block.

<A NAME="Creating a New Block"></A>Creating or Editing a New Block</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There are two methods that may be used to create a block within
Post Builder.&nbsp; From the sequence or event dialogs you may drag a blank
block and drop it into a sequence or event.&nbsp; You can also edit any
existing block with the sequence, event or N/C Data Definitions block dialog.&nbsp;
After you have placed the new block in the correct sequence or selected
a block to edit, the following dialog will be displayed so that you can
now select words from the word select pull down to edit or build your block.

<P><IMG SRC="imagei4a.jpg" HEIGHT=765 WIDTH=1026>

<P>You can build your block by inserting the following elements into your
block.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
<A NAME="New Word"></A><B>New Word</B></H4>
<IMG SRC="image5tk.jpg" HEIGHT=627 WIDTH=508>

<P>Select the&nbsp;<A NAME="New Word"></A><B>New Word</B> option in the
word selection pull down dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depress and hold the left
mouse button on the&nbsp;<A NAME="Add Word"></A><B>Add Word</B> button
and drag the word until the highlight appears in the block construction
area.&nbsp; Once the word is placed into the block, a dialog will appear
to allow you to define the parameters for the word you want to create.&nbsp;&nbsp;
See the <A HREF="#Address">Word</A> section for editing options.

<P>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Text"></A><B>Text</B></H4>
Select the <B>Text</B> option in the block selection pull down dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Depress and hold the left mouse button on the&nbsp;<A NAME="Add Word"></A><B>Add
Word</B> button and drag the word until the highlight appears in the block
construction area.&nbsp; Once the word is placed into the block a dialog
will appear to allow you to define the parameters for the word you want
to create
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Existing Addresses"></A><B>Existing Words</B></H4>
Select the word selection pull down dialog and choose the specific word
that you would like to add to the current block.&nbsp; Each word from this
list has a choice of pre-defined contexts.&nbsp; For instance, the X word
can be defined to be output as any one of the definitions on the pull down
list or you can specify a specific variable that you create using the&nbsp;<A NAME="User Defined Expression"></A>User
Defined Expression option.&nbsp; If you choose an existing word it will
output whatever the current value is for that word.&nbsp; If you choose
X-Coordinate for example, it will output an X word with the current X position.&nbsp;
See the section on words for details on creating and editing words.

<A NAME="Words"></A>Words</H2>
<IMG SRC="imageotv.jpg" HEIGHT=752 WIDTH=1008>

<P>This dialog allows you to create and edit words.&nbsp; You have the
same options for creating a new word or editing a word as you do within
the event or sequence dialogs.&nbsp; When you create a new word from this
dialog you are basically copying an existing word and the editing it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><IMG SRC="imagedin.jpg" HEIGHT=627 WIDTH=508>

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="word dialog"></A>word dialog allows you to define
or edit the characteristics of any word.&nbsp; A word is composed of an
address leader, a number or text and a trailer.&nbsp; An address leader
may be any characters.&nbsp; For NC code the address leader is usually
a single letter such as G, M or X.&nbsp; It can be multiple characters
such as R2, (FI, etc.&nbsp; The trailer is usually blank.&nbsp; This is
needed for some controls that require formats such as &lt;12.345>.&nbsp;
In this case > would be the trailer.

<P>You can specific which&nbsp;<A NAME="format"></A>format will be used
for the current word.&nbsp; You can select from the existing list of formats
or you can edit one of the existing formats.&nbsp; If need a completely
different format or don't want to change one of the existing formats, you
will need to create a new format in the <A HREF="#Format">Format</A> section
of the NC Data Definitions dialog.&nbsp; The format is used control whether
you output the decimal, leading and trailing zeroes etc.

<P>The green rectangle at the top of the dialog shows you what the word
will look like when it is output.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you have an word that
has a pre-defined context, then the pre-defined representative code will
be displayed at the top of the dialog.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Modality"></A>Modality option may be set to Off which
means Modal or Always which means Non-Modal.&nbsp; If set to Modal the
word will only be output if the value of the expression changes between
two blocks of output.&nbsp; This is the default setting for all words.&nbsp;
If a word is set to Non-Modal it is output in every block that the word
appears.&nbsp; Typically Modal words are for coordinate data, motion G
codes, etc.&nbsp; You can always force out within the context of an event.&nbsp;
For instance, the Opstop event should always force an M01.

<P>For each word you can also define the&nbsp;<A NAME="maximum and minimum"></A>maximum
and minimum value that will be output with your word.&nbsp; You can also
determine what action will take place when maximum or minimum value is
exceeded.&nbsp; Your choices are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
<A NAME="Truncate"></A>Truncate</H4>
This setting will cause a warning to be output to the system warning file
and continue using the maximum or minimum value.
<H4>
<A NAME="Warning"></A>Warning</H4>
This setting will cause only a warning to be output.
<H4>
<A NAME="Abort"></A>Abort</H4>
This setting will cause the postprocessor to stop and report an error.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The&nbsp;<A NAME="expression"></A>expression defines the number or text
that will be used to make your word.&nbsp; The expression can only be defined
in the context of an event.&nbsp; The same word used in different events
can have different expressions defining the output.&nbsp; For instance,
the M word in the Opstop event would use the system code for opstop (1).&nbsp;
The M word in the stop event would use the system code for stop (0).&nbsp;
The expression cannot be defined in the NC Data Definitions section because
that dialog only defines the static characteristics of the word.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you select a word that has a pre-defined context you will not be able
to change the expression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Word Modifiers"></A>Word Modifiers</H4>
The word modifiers can only be applied when editing a word within the event
or sequence dialogs.&nbsp; The word modifiers actually belong to the event
or sequence themselves and not to any block or word.&nbsp; You can access
the word modifier dialog by right clicking on any word in any event or
sequence dialog. If you right click on the M01 word and select&nbsp;<A NAME="Change Element,"></A>Change
Element, you can use a different pre-defined context for your M code or
select User Defined Expression.

<P><IMG SRC="image63b.jpg" HEIGHT=194 WIDTH=429>

<P>In the above example for M, you can choose from a list pre-defined M-codes.&nbsp;
Words use the system variables that are assigned for each function.&nbsp;
The Stop Program M-code is defined in the M-code table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can specify the value for your word by selecting user-defined expression
from the list.&nbsp; This expression can be any valid TCL expression.&nbsp;
Typically you can enter a number, text or mom variable.&nbsp; See the UG
Post online docs for a list of mom variables.&nbsp; For example if want
an M10 for your word, enter the text 10 for your expression.&nbsp; This
is a valid expression.&nbsp; Other valid expressions are 6 for M6 and the
text "spindle" would be Mspindle.&nbsp; All mom variables must be preceded
by a $ or they will be considered to be literal text.&nbsp; The text "mom_spindle_speed"
is literal text, but the text "$mom_spindle_speed" will be resolved into
the current value of the variable "mom_spindle_speed".&nbsp; Note that
if you specify digit or numeric formats, your expression must resolve into
a number.

<P><IMG SRC="image2r4.jpg" HEIGHT=124 WIDTH=401>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>If you make a word&nbsp;<A NAME="optional"></A>optional, that means
that it will only be output if the expression used for that word has been
defined.&nbsp; For example, if you make a block with a word that will turn
on the coolant.&nbsp; If you don't program a coolant UDE in your part program,
the data for coolant will not be set.&nbsp; If you do not use the option
specifier, then you will get a run time TCL error.&nbsp; If you do use
the optional specifier, then you will not get an error, instead you will
get no output.&nbsp; This is what is desired because you will only get
your coolant code output if you program the coolant UDE.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="No Word Separator"></A>No Word Separator option allows
you to suppress the output of the word separator after the word.&nbsp;
This is useful mainly for CLS output.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="Force Output"></A>Force Output option allows you to
force the output of your word within the current block only.&nbsp; This
is useful for forcing out a T code or M06 for each tool change.&nbsp; By
default all words are modal and will output only if the value changes from
one block to the next.&nbsp; Force Output can only be specified within
the context of an event or sequence.

<P>UG/Post Builder has grouped the G and M code words into modal groupings.&nbsp;
That is, when you output a G17 it does not cancel a G01.&nbsp; However
if you output a G00, then a G01, and then a G00 in the third block, the
G00 is output again in the third block.&nbsp; This behavior is consistent
with the method that machine tool controls output code.&nbsp; UG/Post Builder
has also constructed many words with predefined variables to assist you
in getting the correct output.&nbsp; For instance, when select an X word
to be output in a block, you have a number of choices on how the number
will be obtained.&nbsp; If you right click on an X word in any event or
sequence dialog you can see what you options are to change how the number
will be obtained.

<P><IMG SRC="imagetld.jpg" HEIGHT=147 WIDTH=396>

<P>In the above pull down dialog you can use the default setting of the
motion x or select one of the options from the list.&nbsp; They all reference
different mom variables or constant.&nbsp; See <A HREF="appendixc.html">Appendix
C</A> for a complete list.
<H2>
<A NAME="Format"></A>Format</H2>
<IMG SRC="imagetmg.jpg" HEIGHT=752 WIDTH=1008>

<P>The Format dialog in NC Data Definitions allow you to create and edit
formats.&nbsp; Post Builder comes with a complete set of formats for all
of the default blocks and addresses.&nbsp; The formats listed here are
used in all of the existing blocks.&nbsp; You can also change formats within
the context of the words using the <A HREF="word_summary.html">word summary
</A>dialog.

<P>You can create a new format by highlighting an existing format and selecting
create.&nbsp; This will give you a new block exactly like the original
except the name will have an _1 after it.&nbsp; You can edit this new format.&nbsp;
This is useful when you need a different format for one of your coordinates.

<P>You can change the data type to be numeric or text.&nbsp; This should
be done only if you know what you are doing.&nbsp; If you specify text
then there is no formatting and all of the other options are not allowed.&nbsp;
All NC data should be numeric except for certain G-codes.&nbsp; For instance,
if you need L for G01, R for G00, CW for G02, etc. then you can change
the type to text and change all of you Motion G codes to the text you want.&nbsp;
This is the only case we have found where it is necessary to use a text
format.

<P>You can also set the&nbsp;<A NAME="number of digits"></A>number of digits
to left and right of the decimal point, supress or output the&nbsp;<A NAME="decimal point,"></A>decimal
point, supress or&nbsp;<A NAME="output leading"></A>output leading or&nbsp;<A NAME="trailing zeros"></A>trailing
zeros or output or&nbsp;<A NAME="suppress the plus"></A>suppress the plus
sign.

<P>The&nbsp;<A NAME="zero format"></A>zero format is used define how a
value of zero will be output.&nbsp; The default format will output X0.0
or X0 for coordinate data.&nbsp; If you want X0. or X.0 then you will need
to change the number of digits accordingly.&nbsp; For non-decimal data
you will get either M00 or M0 depending on whether you suppress leading
zeros or not.

You have the following choices.

<P><IMG SRC="imagedbt.jpg" HEIGHT=175 WIDTH=167>

<P>The default setting for the word sepatarator is a space.&nbsp; This
means your words will have a space between. Example: N0010 G01 X1.23.
<BR>You can also specify any text as your word separator.

<H4>
<A NAME="End of Block"></A>End of Block</H4>
You have the following choices.

<P><IMG SRC="imagek8s.jpg" HEIGHT=199 WIDTH=164>

<P>The default end of block is none.&nbsp; The system will place a line
feed at the end of every block for you.&nbsp; This is if you need an additional
code at the end of block.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These two characters will define how the system will output operator
messages when you construct&nbsp;<A NAME="operator message blocks"></A>operator
message blocks from the block selection pulldown in the event and sequence
dialogs.&nbsp; You can format the exact start and end of message strings
with this dialog.&nbsp; The default characters are "(" for message start
and ")" for message end.&nbsp; A common message start is (MSG,.
