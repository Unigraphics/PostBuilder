<A NAME="Canned Cycles"></A>Canned Cycles</H4>
<IMG SRC="imageiij.jpg" HEIGHT=985 WIDTH=1008>

<P>This dialog will allow you to configure the output canned drilling cycles.&nbsp;
UG/Post Builder will allow you to define all the parameters necessary to
format the canned cycles for your machine tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the
cycle parameters to modify the current settings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Cycle Parameters"></A>Cycle Parameters</H4>
<IMG SRC="imageen5.jpg" HEIGHT=845 WIDTH=808>

<P>The dialog will allow you define and display how your basic canned cycles
will behave.&nbsp; You can define the G code that will be used with each
of the pre-defined cycles generated by the system.&nbsp; You can also modify
them using the G-code dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also define how each
element of the canned cycle will be output.&nbsp; For each canned cycle
there will be a position over the hole to the&nbsp;<A NAME="rapid clearance plane"></A>rapid
clearance plane in X Y and Z.&nbsp; The tool will then feed to depth.&nbsp;
In some cycles there will incremental feeds (DEEP, BRKCHP) and in others
you may have a programmed dwell at the bottom of the hole (DRILL,DWELL;
BORE,DWELL; BORE,MANUAL,DWELL).&nbsp; The tool will then either feed up
or rapid up depending upon the cycle.&nbsp; After the cycle is completed
you can program an additional retract to the RTRCTO plane.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Cycle Start"></A>Cycle Start</H4>
<IMG SRC="image8s4.jpg" HEIGHT=309 WIDTH=719>

<P>You can also define how your canned cycles are defined and executed.&nbsp;
Most canned cycles are defined and executed with a single block.

<P>G81 X Y Z R F

<P>This will cause a hole to be drilled at location XY.

<P>However, some controls need a definition block and an execution block
(<A NAME="Cycle Start Block"></A>Cycle Start Block).

<P>G81 Z R F
<BR>G79 X Y

<P>The G79 block will cause a hole to be drilled at location XY.

<P>If you only need a G79 XY block, you can remove the Z from the&nbsp;<A NAME="G79 block"></A>G79
block.
<BR>If you require a different G code, you can modify the G ode.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Rapid To"></A>Rapid To</H4>
This parameter allows you to define how your canned cycle block handles
the&nbsp;<A NAME="RAPTO"></A>RAPTO or&nbsp;<A NAME="minimum clearance distance"></A>minimum
clearance distance.&nbsp; Depending on how your canned cycles are configured
there are a number of choices you can select.

<P><IMG SRC="image4p5.jpg" HEIGHT=441 WIDTH=672>

<P>The default and most common setting is to output&nbsp;<A NAME="R in the canned cycle block."></A>R
in the canned cycle block.&nbsp; The post will add the rapid to clearance
distance along the tool axis to the&nbsp;<A NAME="top of the hole position."></A>top
of the hole position.

<P><IMG SRC="imagekqd.jpg" HEIGHT=350 WIDTH=646>

<P>The setting of None for the Rapid To parameter is useful if your machine
uses&nbsp;<A NAME="cams"></A>cams or has manual control of the drilling
cycles.&nbsp; Notice that the Z and F words have been deleted as well.

<P><IMG SRC="imagemip.jpg" HEIGHT=337 WIDTH=631>

<P>The option of&nbsp;<A NAME="Rapid Traverse & R"></A>Rapid Traverse &amp;
R will do a rapid positioning move to a point above the hole and then perform
the drilling cycle.

<P><IMG SRC="imagedlp.jpg" HEIGHT=376 WIDTH=625>

<P>The setting of&nbsp;<A NAME="Rapid is used for machines such as the Bridgeport"></A>Rapid
is used for machines such as the Bridgeport that do not have an R word
in the canned cycle.&nbsp; The post must position in X, Y and Z above the
hole to the rapid clearance plane.&nbsp; The canned cycle itself will only
feed in Z.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Retract To"></A>Retract To</H4>
This parameter defines how your postprocessor will handle the&nbsp;<A NAME="RTRCTO"></A>RTRCTO
parameter in a canned cycle block.&nbsp; The RTRCTO parameter, when specified,&nbsp;
will cause an additional retraction after the canned cycle is completed.&nbsp;
The following options are available in UG/Post Builder in order for you
to define your output.&nbsp; The RTRCTO position is detemined by adding
the RTRCTO parameter to the top of the hole position along the spindle
axis.

<P>The option None means that the parameter will be ignored.&nbsp; The
postprocessor assumes that the canned cycle will control this function.

<P><IMG SRC="imagej4k.jpg" HEIGHT=331 WIDTH=615>

<P>The option K will output a&nbsp;<A NAME="K word in the canned cycle"></A>K
word in the canned cycle block.&nbsp; This is used by Kearney &amp; Trecker
controls specifically.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><IMG SRC="image3u0.jpg" HEIGHT=315 WIDTH=632>

<P>The setting of&nbsp;<A NAME="G98/G99"></A>G98/G99 will include a G98
or G99 code in each canned cycle block.&nbsp; This is used by Fanuc controls
and determines whether the tool retracts to the R plane or the last non
cycle Z position before the canned cycle.&nbsp; The parameter&nbsp;<A NAME="RTRCTO,MANUAL"></A>RTRCTO,MANUAL
causes the post to output a G99 and the parameter&nbsp;<A NAME="RTRCTO,AUTO"></A>RTRCTO,AUTO
causes the postprocessor to output a G98.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><IMG SRC="imageg63.jpg" HEIGHT=530 WIDTH=639>

<P>The setting of&nbsp;<A NAME="Rapid Spindle"></A>Rapid Spindle will cause
the postprocessor to output a rapid move along the tool axis after each
canned cycle to the retract to position.

<P><IMG SRC="image872.jpg" HEIGHT=467 WIDTH=623>

<P>The setting of&nbsp;<A NAME="Cycle Off then Rapid Spindle"></A>Cycle
Off then Rapid Spindle will cause the postprocessor to cancel the canned
cycle and then output a rapid move along the tool axis after each canned
cycle to the retract to position.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Cycle Plane Control"></A>Cycle Plane Control</H4>

<H4>
<A NAME="Cycle Plane Change"></A>Cycle Plane Change</H4>
Each of the cycle types can be customized to output additional words.&nbsp;
For instance, the deep cycle can have additional specifiers for step, step
increment, etc.&nbsp; Note that the parameter must be specified in your
canned cycle for the word to be available. You can select this word from
the word selection pull down.&nbsp; UG/Post Builder provides you with the
following addresses that you can use to include in your canned cycles:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>P</TD>

<TD><A NAME="cycle delay"></A></TD>

<TD>cycle delay</TD>

<TD></TD>

<TD>This is delay value in seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is available in any
canned cycle with the word DWELL in it.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Q</TD>

<TD><A NAME="cycle_step"></A></TD>

<TD>cycle_step</TD>

<TD></TD>

<TD>This will be step #1 in the cycle parameter dialog.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>I</TD>

<TD></TD>

<TD><A NAME="cycle_step1"></A>cycle_step1</TD>

<TD></TD>

<TD>This will be step #2 in the cycle parameter dialog</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>Another method that may be used is to specify a user defined event to
a tool or operation and use the mom variable you have created in the canned
cycle.
