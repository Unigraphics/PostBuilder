<P>This section will allow you to create a&nbsp;<A NAME="Tcl procedure"></A>Tcl
procedure that may be executed from any marker or event.&nbsp; The system
will place all of the correct syntax around the body of your proc.&nbsp;
It will create the first and last line in your proc.&nbsp; The first line
will be:

<P>proc PB_CMD_name_of_proc {} {

<P>and the last line will be

<P>}

<P>This proc will be executed in the sequence that it was placed.&nbsp;
Note that Post Builder will not check the validity of the syntax of custom
procs.&nbsp; This option is for advanced users only.&nbsp; Post Builder
will supply a number of "canned" custom commands that will do pre-determined
functions.&nbsp; Only advanced users should modify any existing custom
commands or create their own custom commands.&nbsp; This option will allow
users to capture the edits to the event handler.
