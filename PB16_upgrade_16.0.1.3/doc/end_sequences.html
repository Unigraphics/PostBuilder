<P>The operation end sequence allows you to specify blocks that you need
to come out at the end of every operation.&nbsp; Typically these are things
like returning to a home position, turning off the spindle or coolant.&nbsp;
If you know you are always going to do the same end of operation functions
at the end of every operation, you can enter these into this sequence instead
of programming UDEs.&nbsp; Note that some operations do not have a tool
change and you might want to handle the end of operation differently depending
on whether the next operation has a tool change.

<P>This sequence allows you specify the blocks or functions that you need
to occur at the end of the program.&nbsp; There is only one marker.
