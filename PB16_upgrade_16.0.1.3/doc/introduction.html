UG/Post Builder creates and edits postprocessors.&nbsp; These posts have
three elements.&nbsp; They are each identified by the base name and one
of three extensions.&nbsp; Assuming your postprocessor name is my_machine_tool.&nbsp;
These files would then be:

<P><A NAME="my_machine_tool.def"></A>my_machine_tool.def&nbsp; -- This
file defines all the static information for the post.&nbsp; This includes
formats, address and NC blocks.&nbsp; The format of this file is a special
syntax created by UG.&nbsp; This file is used by UG/Post to postprocess
the tool path and generate NC code.

<P><A NAME="my_machine_tool.tcl"></A>my_machine_tool.tcl -- This file determines
the blocks that need to be output from events that are generating by UG
Post.&nbsp; This file uses the Tcl language and is completely created by
Post Builder every time you save your post.&nbsp; UG/Post also uses this
file at run time to generate NC code.

<P><A NAME="my_machine_tool.pui"></A>my_machine_tool.pui&nbsp; -- This
file is used by post builder only and not by UG/Post.&nbsp; This file contains
static information on how to write out the .tcl file.&nbsp; Although UG/Post
does not need this file, it must be present in the same directory as the
.tcl and .def files in order to edit your post.

<P>By default UG/Post Builder will create your post in the directory that
you started UG/Post Builder.&nbsp; Use the Save As option in the file dialog
to save your post in the directory of your choice.&nbsp; In order to use
your postprocessor in Unigraphics you must add an entry to your template_post.dat
file in your current postprocessor directory.

<P>

<A NAME="Creating a New"></A>Creating a New Post</H1>
&nbsp;<IMG SRC="images14.jpg" HEIGHT=134 WIDTH=1008>

<P>Either select the new file icon or select new in the file dialog.&nbsp;
You then will need to make several initial choices from the Create New
Postprocessor dialog.

<P><IMG SRC="imageatc.jpg" HEIGHT=580 WIDTH=623>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At this point you must select the&nbsp;<A NAME="name"></A>name of your
postprocessor or use the default name.

<P>You can optionally enter a&nbsp;<A NAME="text"></A>text description
of your postprocessor.

<P>You can specify whether the output will be&nbsp;<A NAME="Units"></A>inches
or millimeters.&nbsp; If you select inch, all coordinate output and formats
will be inches.&nbsp; If you specify metric, all coordinate output will
be in millimeters.&nbsp; All of the default parameters such as tolerances,
minimums and maximums will be based upon the output units.

<P>You must select a&nbsp;<A NAME="machine type."></A>machine type.&nbsp;
Once this option is selected you may not change it again for this postprocessor.&nbsp;
The choices are:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>&middot;&nbsp;<A NAME="Mill"></A>Mill</B>

<P>This option defines your machine as a mill type.&nbsp; This means you
have three linear axis (Cartesian X, Y and Z) and up to two rotary axis.&nbsp;
This option has additional choices to define the axes are to be used.

<P><IMG SRC="image6bb.jpg" HEIGHT=580 WIDTH=623>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>&nbsp;<A NAME="Lathe"></A>Lathe</B></LI>

<BR>This option defines your machine to a lathe type.&nbsp; Typically lathes
have two linear axes (Cartesian X and Z).&nbsp; The chuck rotates and the
tool is in a turret that moves in the X and Z-axis.</UL>
You must now select a basic controller type.&nbsp; At present only generic
is available.&nbsp; The basic default options are set to a Fanuc 6M.</BLOCKQUOTE>
