<P>The listing dialog will allow you to control how the listing file will
be formatted.&nbsp; You can also define how your post will handle groups,
warnings and the review tool.&nbsp; You can also define what the default
extension will be on your NC output file and your listing file.

<A NAME="Group Output"></A>Generate Group Output</H4>
This option will allow you to define how your post will handle groups.&nbsp;
You can organize your operations into groups in Unigraphics to create more
than one NC program in a part file.&nbsp; Each group is considered to be
a program and should be considered one complete NC tape.

<P>The default setting for this option is OFF.&nbsp; You should not use
this option unless you want to postprocess more than one NC program at
a time.

<P>If you select more than one group and you have this option turned ON
you will get one file that contains all of the groups (programs) that you
have selected.&nbsp; This file will be named my_file.ptp.&nbsp; You will
also get an NC program file for each group or program you have selected.&nbsp;
They will be named my_file_group.ptp.&nbsp; If your base file name is "nctape"
and your group or program name is "O1234" then the name of your file will
be nctape_O1234.ptp.

<P>When using the group output is ON, you should not mix operations in
groups with operations outside of groups.&nbsp; This will cause unpredictable
output.

<P>When the group output setting is OFF, you will only get a single NC
output file called my_file.ptp.&nbsp; All operations in any selected group
will be output in a single NC file.&nbsp; All group organization will be
ignored.

<P>The name of the group or program in Unigraphics can be used as the program
name in the Start of Program event.&nbsp; This will be passed to you as
the variable name mom_group_name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Output Warning Messages"></A>Output Warning Messages</H4>
When this option is set to ON, warnings will be output to a warning log
file.&nbsp; The name of this file will be named my_file_warning.out and
will reside in the same directory that your NC output is located.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
<A NAME="Activate Review Tool"></A>Activate Review Tool</H4>
When this option is set to ON, an analysis program will be executed to
help you review the output of your postprocessor.&nbsp; Three display windows
will be presented.&nbsp; The first window will show you all of the events
that were created by the Unigraphics event generator.&nbsp; The middle
window will show you all of the variables that were created and passed
to your postprocessor during that event.&nbsp; The third window is a list
of the NC output that was generated by your postprocessor.&nbsp; If you
select any event in the first column, it will show you all of the data
generated during that event and the third window will show you the NC code
the was generated for that event.&nbsp; If you select any peice of NC code
in the third window, the listing at the top of the display will show you
the event that caused the NC code.

<P>The review tool runs after all of the NC code has been generated.&nbsp;
It is not a run time debugger.

<P>The file ugwish.exe must be located in the mach/auxiliary directory
for the review tool to work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
