<P>This dialog allows you to define the output characteristics of each
of the words that your postprocessor will output.&nbsp; Note that this
dialog will modify groups of words that use the same format.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This dialog allows you modify the format.&nbsp; If you want to specify
a different format one of the words, you must go to the word address section
of N/C Data Definitions.&nbsp; The following fields are available:

<P><A NAME="Address"></A><B>Address</B>
<BR>This field is the name of the word used by the system.&nbsp; This name
is the same name that you will find in the word address section of the
N/C Data Definitions section.

<P><A NAME="Leader/Code"></A><B>Leader/Code</B>
<BR>This field will allow you to modify the leader for any word.&nbsp;
The leader is the character than precedes the numeric information.&nbsp;
For instance, if the word is X12.345, then the leader is X.&nbsp; You can
either type in a new leader or right click on the existing leader and choose
from the list.

<P><IMG SRC="image7nh.jpg" HEIGHT=201 WIDTH=218>

<P><A NAME="Data Type"></A><B>Data Type</B>
<BR>The data type can be either numeric or text.&nbsp; Usually all N/C
code is numeric.&nbsp; You will need to specify text when the code you
need cannot be formatted from a number directly into a word address and
a value like most N/C code.&nbsp; One example of this is if you need a
G84.1 for tapping and G81 (without a decimal) for drilling.&nbsp; In this
case you have to make the G_motion word a text and change all the G codes
to G81 instead of 81 and a leader of G.&nbsp; You can also go to the format
dialog in N/C Data Definitions to change only the G_motion word to text.

<P><A NAME="Plus (+)"></A><B>Plus (+)</B>
<BR>This option will allow you to get a plus sign for all positive numbers.&nbsp;
If you set this option to no you will get an X1.0.&nbsp; If you set this
to yes, you will get an X+1.0.&nbsp; You will always get a minus sign for
all numeric data if the specified number is negative.

<P><A NAME="Lead Zero"></A><B>Lead Zero</B>
<BR>The option will allow you to define whether you will output leading
zeroes with your N/C Code.

<P><A NAME="Integer"></A><B>Integer</B>
<BR>This option will control how many digits are output to the left of
the decimal point.&nbsp; You will get an error if your numeric data exceeds
the format you have specified.

<P><A NAME="Decimal (.)"></A><B>Decimal (.)</B>
<BR>This option will control whether or not the numeric data has a decimal
point.&nbsp; You will get an error if you suppress the decimal point and
do not output at least leading or trailing zeroes.

<P><A NAME="Fraction"></A><B>Fraction</B>
<BR>This option determines how many digits will be output to right of the
decimal point.

<P><A NAME="Trail Zero"></A><B>Trail Zero</B>
<BR>The option will allow you to define whether you will output trailing
zeroes with your N/C Code.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Post Builder will automatically output a zero format that is compatible
with the options you have chosen.&nbsp; If you suppressed the decimal point,
your format for outputting zero will be M0.&nbsp; If you are outputting
the decimal point, your zero format will be X0.0.&nbsp; If you want to
change how your postprocessor will output a value of zero for your coordinate
data, see the <A HREF="data_definitions.html#zero format">zero option </A>for
formats in the N/C Data Definitions section.
