<A NAME="Program Start Sequence"></A>Program Start Sequence</H3>
This sequence has only one marker, the start of program.&nbsp; This window
allows you to determine which blocks are output when this event occurs
in the tool path.&nbsp; It is important to note that the start of program
event occurs before any other event is handled.&nbsp; Any UDE (User Defined
Event) data is only available after the Start of Program Event.
<H3>
<A NAME="Operation Start Sequence"></A>Operation Start Sequence</H3>
<IMG SRC="imageigm.jpg" HEIGHT=897 WIDTH=1008>

<P>This sequence defines the blocks that can be output at the start of
each operation.&nbsp; Every operation will have a first tool change, automatic
tool change, manual tool change or no tool change.&nbsp; See the list of
scenarios below for the events output with each scenario.

<P>The Operation Start Sequence has the following <A HREF="#Markers">markers</A>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
<A NAME="Start of Operation"></A>Start of Operation</H4>
This event is generated by the system and will be generated when you postprocess
an operation.&nbsp; This event will occur whether or not there is a tool
change.
<H4>
<A NAME="From Move"></A>From Move</H4>
This event will only occur if there is a FROM programmed in the operation.&nbsp;
If you attach a block to this marker, it will only be output if there is
a FROM in the operation.
<H4>
<A NAME="First Tool"></A>First Tool</H4>
This event will only occur for the first tool change in a program.&nbsp;
This is useful if you already have a tool in the spindle and you wish to
handle it differently.&nbsp; If this marker has no blocks attached to it,
the blocks being output will be the same as the automatic tool change block.
<H4>
<A NAME="Automatic Tool Change"></A>Automatic Tool Change</H4>
This event will occur on only if the operation contains a tool change.&nbsp;
A tool change is triggered by the system only when the tool is different
between the current operation and the previous operation.&nbsp; Note that
this event is not related to the post command LOAD/TOOL.&nbsp; This event
will occur BEFORE the post command LOAD/TOOL is output.&nbsp; You cannot
use any of the LOAD/TOOL data with this event.
<H4>
<A NAME="Manual Tool Change"></A>Manual Tool Change</H4>
This event will occur only if there is a manual tool change.
<H4>
<A NAME="Initial Move"></A>Initial Move</H4>
This event will be generated only if the operation has a tool change.&nbsp;
The system will create this event if there is no positioning move after
the tool change.&nbsp; All Start Post User Defined Events will be triggered
before the initial or first move in an operation.&nbsp; This event is the
best place to handle the data triggered by operation level UDEs.
<H4>
<A NAME="First Move"></A>First Move</H4>
This event will only occur if there is no tool change in the operation.&nbsp;
Every operation will have either a first move or an initial move.&nbsp;
These events will allow you to combine blocks either before with or after
the first motion block of the operation.&nbsp; If there is no motion before
the canned cycle, a motion block will be created to position to the rapid
clearance plane above the hole.
<H4>
<A NAME="Approach Move"></A>Approach Move</H4>
This event will only occur if there is an approach move programmed in the
operation.&nbsp; Events attached to this event will only be output if there
is an approach move in the operation.&nbsp; Any blocks attached to this
event will be output before the actual approach move motion block.
<H4>
<A NAME="Engage Move"></A>Engage Move</H4>
This event will only occur if there is an engage move in the operation.&nbsp;
Events attached to this event will only be output if there is an engage
move in the operation.&nbsp; Any blocks attached to this event will be
output before the actual engage move motion block.
<H4>
<A NAME="First Cut"></A>First Cut</H4>
This event will occur before the first cut move.&nbsp; Any blocks attached
to this event will be output before the actual first cut move motion block.</BLOCKQUOTE>
There are four possible scenarios for event markers that can occur at the
start of an operation.
