<A NAME="Word Sequencing"></A>Word Sequencing</H2>
This dialog allows you to define the order in which all the words in your
postprocessor will be output.&nbsp; The relative order of the words in
this dialog will be enforced throughout your entire postprocessor.&nbsp;
For example, if you exchange the X and Y words, it will immediately be
reflected in all the blocks in all events.&nbsp; You can also suppress
or make any word active.&nbsp; Select any word and it will change from
pink to blue indicating that it is now suppressed.&nbsp; If Balloon Help
is active each word will display the context of that word.&nbsp; By default,
a representative code is used to display that word.&nbsp; For example,
the G17 word can also be G18 or G19.&nbsp; In other cases a D or T represents
the adjust register or tool number register.&nbsp; Any change to the leader
for that word will be reflected in this dialog.
